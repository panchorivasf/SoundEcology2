\title{Calculate Soundscape Dynamicity}
\usage{
dynamicity(wave, fun = "mean", segment_l = 5, freq_res = 50, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{A \code{Wave} object (from \code{tuneR} package) containing the audio data.}

\item{fun}{Function to apply in spectral calculation (\code{"mean"}, \code{"var"}, etc.).
Passed to \code{seewave::meanspec(FUN)}.}

\item{segment_l}{Length (in seconds) of each analysis segment. Longer segments provide
better frequency resolution but fewer temporal comparisons (default: 5s).}

\item{freq_res}{Frequency resolution (in Hz) for spectral analysis. Higher values
increase frequency binning (default: 50Hz).}

\item{plot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), generates a heatmap of spectral changes.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{dynamicity}: Scalar metric of overall acoustic variability (mean ΔMPS across all bins).
\item \code{delta_mps}: Matrix of absolute MPS differences between segments (frequency bins × time).
\item \code{dynamicity_vector}: Frequency-specific variability (sum of ΔMPS per bin).
\item \code{frequency}: Vector of frequency bins (kHz).
\item \code{time}: Vector of segment mid-point times (s).
}
}
\description{
Quantifies temporal variability in acoustic energy across frequency bins by comparing
mean power spectra (MPS) between consecutive segments of an audio recording. Useful for
identifying periods of rapid acoustic change in soundscapes.
}
\details{
The function works by:
\enumerate{
\item Dividing the audio into equal-length segments.
\item Calculating mean power spectra (MPS) for each segment.
\item Computing absolute differences in MPS between consecutive segments.
\item Summarizing these differences as a "dynamicity" metric.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(tuneR)
data(tico)
dyn <- dynamicity(tico, segment_l = 1, freq_res = 100)
}
