\usage{
fadi_folder(
  folder,
  save_csv = TRUE,
  csv_name = "fadi_results.csv",
  noise_file = NULL,
  NEM = 2,
  min_freq = 200,
  max_freq = 10000,
  threshold_fixed = -50,
  freq_step = 1000,
  gamma = 13,
  props = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder}{a path to the folder with audio files to import.}

\item{save_csv}{logical. Whether to save a csv in the working directory.}

\item{csv_name}{character vector. When 'save_csv' is TRUE, optionally provide a file name.}

\item{noise_file}{An R object of class Wave containing noise-only information if needed. Default = NULL.}

\item{NEM}{Numeric. Options are 1 or 2.
When NEM = 1, floating thresholds are estimated based on noise_file.
When NEM = 2, floating thresholds are calculated based on sound file using an
automatic noise level estimation method (median of each row in the spectrogram). Default = 2.}

\item{min_freq}{Minimum frequency in Hertz when calculating the global threshold. Default = 200.}

\item{max_freq}{Maximum frequency in Hertz when calculating the FADI value. Default = 10000.}

\item{threshold_fixed}{A negative number in dB for calculating the global threshold. Default = âˆ’50.}

\item{freq_step}{Bandwidth of each frequency band, in Hertz. Default = 1000.}

\item{gamma}{A positive number in dB for calculating the floating thresholds. Default = 13.}

\item{props}{Logical; if TRUE, the energy proportion values for each frequency band
and channel are added to the output tibble. Default = TRUE.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the FADI value per channel, energy proportions, metadata, and parameters used.
}
\description{
The Frequency-dependent Acoustic Diversity Index by Xu et al. (2023) obtains a floating noise profile
before calculating the Acoustic Diversity Index and it doesn't use normalized spectrogram.
Alternatively it can take a noise sample to reduce noise in the analyzed files.
}
\details{
Modified version of the Frequency-dependent Acoustic Diversity Index by Xu et al. (2023).
FADI was introduced in: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X23010828.
This version returns a wide format (one row per audio file) tibble as output instead of a nested list.
To see the original version as in the paper, use the \emph{frequency_dependent_acoustic_diversity()} function.
