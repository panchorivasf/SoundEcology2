\arguments{
\item{folder}{a path to the folder with audio files to import.}

\item{recursive}{Logical. Whether to search in subfolders. Default is TRUE.}

\item{list}{An optional list (subset) of files in the folder to analyze. If provided,
files outside the list will be excluded.}

\item{start}{numerical. Where to start reading the Wave.}

\item{end}{numerical. Where to end reading the Wave.}

\item{unit}{character. Unit of measurement for 'start' and 'end'. Options are
'samples', 'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours'. Default is 'minutes'.}

\item{save.csv}{logical. Whether to save a csv in the working directory.}

\item{csv.name}{character vector. When 'save.csv' is TRUE, optionally provide a file name.}

\item{noise.file}{An R object of class Wave containing noise-only information if needed. Default = NULL.}

\item{NEM}{Numeric. Options are 1 or 2.
When NEM = 1, floating thresholds are estimated based on noise.file.
When NEM = 2, floating thresholds are calculated based on sound file using an
automatic noise level estimation method (median of each row in the spectrogram). Default = 2.}

\item{min.freq}{Minimum frequency in Hertz when calculating the global threshold. Default = 200.}

\item{max.freq}{Maximum frequency in Hertz when calculating the FADI value. Default = 10000.}

\item{threshold.fixed}{A negative number in dB for calculating the global threshold. Default = âˆ’50.}

\item{freq.step}{Bandwidth of each frequency band, in Hertz. Default = 1000.}

\item{gamma}{A positive number in dB for calculating the floating thresholds. Default = 13.}

\item{props}{Logical; if TRUE, the energy proportion values for each frequency band
and channel are added to the output tibble. Default = TRUE.}

\item{n.cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel processing. Use \code{n.cores = -1} to use all but one core.
Default is NULL (single-core processing).}
}
\value{
A tibble with the FADI value per channel, energy proportions, metadata, and parameters used.
}
\description{
The Frequency-dependent Acoustic Diversity Index by Xu et al. (2023) obtains a floating noise profile
before calculating the Acoustic Diversity Index and it doesn't use normalized spectrogram.
Alternatively it can take a noise sample to reduce noise in the analyzed files.
}
\details{
Modified version of the Frequency-dependent Acoustic Diversity Index by Xu et al. (2023).
FADI was introduced in: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X23010828.
This version returns a wide format (one row per audio file) tibble as output instead of a nested list.
To see the original version as in the paper, use the \emph{frequency_dependent_acoustic_diversity()} function.
