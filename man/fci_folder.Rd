\arguments{
\item{folder}{The folder containing the WAV files to analyze.}

\item{output.csv}{The name of the CSV file where results will be saved. Default is "frequency_cover_results.csv".}

\item{channel}{The channel to analyze: 'left', 'right', 'mix' (combine both), or 'each' (process left and right channels separately). Default is 'left'.}

\item{rm.offset}{Logical. Whether to remove the DC offset from the signal. Default is TRUE.}

\item{hpf}{High-pass filter cutoff frequency in Hz. If 0, no high-pass filter is applied. Default is 0.}

\item{cutoff}{The amplitude threshold (in dB) below which frequencies will be considered inactive. Default is -60.}

\item{freq.res}{Frequency resolution of the spectrogram in Hz. Default is 100.}

\item{plot}{Logical. Whether to generate plots for each file. Default is FALSE.}

\item{ggplot}{Logical. Whether to use ggplot2 for plotting (if plot is TRUE). Default is FALSE.}

\item{plot.title}{Title for the plot if plotting is enabled. Default is "Frequency Cover Analysis".}

\item{sound.color}{The color to use for active frequencies in the plot. Default is "#045E10" (a dark green shade).}

\item{lf.min}{The minimum frequency (in Hz) for the low-frequency band. Default is 0.}

\item{lf.max}{The maximum frequency (in Hz) for the low-frequency band. Default is 1500.}

\item{mf.min}{The minimum frequency (in Hz) for the mid-frequency band. Default is 1500.}

\item{mf.max}{The maximum frequency (in Hz) for the mid-frequency band. Default is 8000.}

\item{hf.min}{The minimum frequency (in Hz) for the high-frequency band. Default is 8000.}

\item{hf.max}{The maximum frequency (in Hz) for the high-frequency band. Default is 18000.}

\item{uf.min}{The minimum frequency (in Hz) for the ultra-high-frequency band. Default is 18000.}

\item{uf.max}{The maximum frequency (in Hz) for the ultra-high-frequency band. Default is 24000.}

\item{n.cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel processing. Use \code{n.cores = -1} to use all but one core. Default is NULL (single-core processing).}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the frequency cover analysis results for each file.
}
\description{
This function performs a frequency cover indices (FCI) on all WAV files within a specified folder.
It processes each sound file in parallel (if specified) and saves the results in a CSV file.
}

\dontrun{
# Run frequency cover analysis on all WAV files in the folder "sound_files"
fci_folder("sound_files", output.csv = "results.csv", channel = "left", n.cores = 4)
