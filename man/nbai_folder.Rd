\title{Narrow-Band Activity Index for Files in a Folder}
\usage{
nbai_folder(
  folder = NULL,
  recursive = FALSE,
  list = NULL,
  start = 0,
  end = 1,
  unit = "minutes",
  channel = "each",
  hpf = 0,
  freq.res = 50,
  cutoff = -60,
  activity.cutoff = 10,
  output.csv = "nbai_results.csv",
  n.cores = -1,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder}{Character. The path to the folder containing the wave files to analyze.}

\item{recursive}{Logical. Whether to search in subfolders. Default is TRUE.}

\item{list}{An optional list (subset) of files in the folder to analyze.}

\item{start}{numerical. Where to start reading the Wave.}

\item{end}{numerical. Where to end reading the Wave.}

\item{unit}{character. Unit of measurement for 'start' and 'end'. Options are
'samples', 'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours'. Default is 'minutes'.}

\item{channel}{Character. If Wave is stereo and you want to use only one channel, pass either "left" or "right"
to this argument. If you want to analyze a mix of both channels, select "mix". If NULL (default),
results are returned for each channel.}

\item{hpf}{Numeric. High-pass filter. The default (500 Hz) should be used always for consistency unless signals
of interest are below that threshold.}

\item{freq.res}{Numeric. Frequency resolution in Hz. This value determines the "height" of each frequency bin and,
therefore, the window length to be used (sampling rate / frequency resolution).}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric. Cutoff threshold defining the sounds that will be analyzed, in dBFS.}

\item{activity.cutoff}{Numeric. Cutoff percent activity. Only the frequency bands active equal or above this
percentage will be considered as "active" in the active band statistics.}

\item{n.cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel processing. Use \code{n.cores = -1} to use all but one core.
Default is NULL (single-core processing).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, details of dynamic range will be printed on the console.}
}
\value{
A list containing: 1) A binary spectrogram (if mono), 2) tibble with the Narrow-Band Activity Index (NBI)
summary statistics, and 3) a tibble with NBI spectral, which number of rows equals the number of frequency bins
in the analysis.
}
\description{
NBAI describes the relative amount of narrow-band persistent sound activity, like that of Cicadas and Orthopterans.
This index can be used to evaluate insect activity and their influence on other soundscape metrics (e.g., summary
acoustic indices).
