\usage{
ribbons(
  folder = NULL,
  recursive = TRUE,
  list = NULL,
  n.cores = -1,
  cutoff = -100,
  max_amp = -10,
  save_ribbons = TRUE,
  save_to = "./ribbons",
  dc_on = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder}{Path to the folder containing WAV files (default: current
working directory).}

\item{recursive}{Logical. Whether to search files in subfolders. Default: TRUE.}

\item{list}{A list with WAV files to parse. The waves must be in the working
directory (default: NULL).}

\item{n.cores}{Number of cores for parallel processing (-1 for all available
cores)}

\item{cutoff}{Minimum dBFS value (noise floor). Values below this will be
clipped (default: -100)}

\item{max_amp}{Maximum dBFS value to be represented by the color scale.}

\item{save_ribbons}{Logical. Whether to save the ribbon plots (default: TRUE)}

\item{save_to}{Character. If save_ribbons = TRUE, provide a path to the folder
where the file should be stored. If no path is provided, a new folder
"ribbon_plots" is created in the current working directory (default) to save
the exported files.}

\item{dc_on}{Number of minutes where the recorded was "on". Used to identify
expected number of files per day.}

\item{dc_off}{Number of minutes where the recorded was "off". Used to identify
expected number of files per day.}

\item{target_dates}{Either a single date or multiple dates in the format
"YYYY-MM-DD" to be analyzed. If NULL (default), all the dates in the folder
will be parsed. To provide a range, see Details.}

\item{ribbon_height}{Height of the ribbon plot in inches (default: 0.05)}

\item{ribbon_width}{Width of the ribbon plot in inches (default: 10)}

\item{freq_bands}{Number of frequency bands for the ribbon (default: 24)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item ribbon_data - Wide-format ribbon data (freq bands Ã— recordings)
\item ribbon_plot_data - Long-format data for plotting ribbons
\item file_metadata - File information with extracted metadata
\item overall_range - The dBFS range of all data
\item ribbon_plots - List of ribbon plot objects (if multiple dates)
}
}
\description{
Creates ribbon visualizations of daily acoustic patterns using
multiple recordings, summarizing spectral data into frequency bands
across multiple days as thin horizontal ribbons. Includes options for
noise floor clipping and parallel processing.
