\usage{
spectral_dynamics(
  wave,
  timestep = 5,
  rmoffset = TRUE,
  highpass = 0,
  lfc = c(0, 2),
  mfc = c(2, 10),
  hfc = c(10, 16),
  ufc = c(16, 24)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{A Wave object representing the audio file to be analyzed.}

\item{timestep}{Numeric value indicating the time step (in seconds) for segmenting the audio file to calculate the Power Spectral Densitiess.}

\item{rmoffset}{Logical value indicating whether to remove DC offset from the audio (default is TRUE).}

\item{highpass}{Numeric value indicating the cutoff frequency for the high-pass filter (in Hz, default is 0 Hz).}

\item{lfc}{A numeric vector of length 2 indicating the lower frequency range (e.g., c(0, 2) for 0-2 Hz).}

\item{mfc}{A numeric vector of length 2 indicating the mid-frequency range (e.g., c(2, 10) for 2-10 Hz).}

\item{hfc}{A numeric vector of length 2 indicating the high-frequency range (e.g., c(10, 16) for 10-16 Hz).}

\item{ufc}{A numeric vector of length 2 indicating the ultra-frequency range (e.g., c(16, 24) for 16-24 Hz).}
}
\value{
A tibble with summary statistics (standard deviation, variance, mean, range) derived from spectral similarity for each frequency band.
The frequency bands are ordered from highest (ufc) to lowest (lfc).
}
\description{
Computes summary statistics based on spectral similarity (consecutive pairwise comparison of PSD vectors) over user-defined time steps for specified frequency bands.
