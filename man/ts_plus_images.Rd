\usage{
ts_plus_images(
  data,
  image_folder = NULL,
  output_file = NULL,
  var_column = "mean_centroid",
  variable_name = NULL,
  identifier = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing the time series data. Must include a 'date' column.}

\item{image_folder}{Character. Path to folder containing images. Images should have
dates in YYYYMMDD format in their filenames (e.g., "sensor_data_20231215.png").
If NULL, no images will be displayed. Default is NULL.}

\item{output_file}{Character. Path for the output HTML file. If provided, creates
a standalone HTML file with accompanying image folder. If NULL, creates a
temporary file and opens in browser. Default is NULL.}

\item{variable_name}{Character. Descriptive name for the y-variable to use in
plot labels and title (e.g., "Temperature", "BBAI Centroid"). If NULL,
uses the y_column name. Default is NULL.}

\item{identifier}{Character. An identifier to include in the plot title
(e.g., sensor ID, location name). If provided, will be shown as
"Interactive Time Series - \link{variable_name} (\link{identifier})". Default is NULL.}

\item{y_column}{Character. Name of the column in data to use for the y-axis values.
Default is "mean_centroid".}

\value{
Invisibly returns the HTML content as a character string.

\description{
Creates an interactive time series plot using Chart.js where users can click
on data points to view corresponding images in a modal popup. Images are
matched to data points based on dates extracted from filenames. Includes
zoom functionality on the horizontal axis.
}
\details{
The function creates an interactive time series plot where:
\itemize{
\item Data points with corresponding images appear as red circles
\item Data points without images appear as blue circles
\item Clicking on data points shows detailed information
\item Clicking on points with images opens a modal with the full-size image
\item The plot includes tooltips and keyboard support (Esc to close modals)
\item Zoom controls for the horizontal axis (drag to zoom, double-click to reset)
}

Image files should contain dates in YYYYMMDD format in their filenames.
Supported image formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP.

When output_file is specified, the function creates:
\itemize{
\item A standalone HTML file at the specified location
\item A "ts_images" subfolder containing copies of all relevant images
}
}

               identifier = "Sensor-001")

# Save to HTML file

               image_folder = "path/to/images",
               output_file = "temperature_analysis.html",
